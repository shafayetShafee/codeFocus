# `codefocus-revealjs` format

This custom format only extends the default [revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format with the revealjs plugin [`reveal-code-focus`](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/reveal-code-focus). That's it.

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template shafayetShafee/codefocus
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your slides.  Itâ€™s also possible to install only the format if you working with an existing project,

```bash
quarto add shafayetShafee/codefocus
```

This will install the extension within a `_extensions` folder in your working project directory. See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html#distributing-formats) for details.


## Usage

To know how to specify the format along with two options `bgcolor` and `scrollToFocused`, see the source code, [template.qmd](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/codefocus/blob/main/template.qmd).

With this custom format, it is possible to highlight a line of code in code-chunk and add some discussion (i.e. text) below the code chunk for that highlighted line of code using [fragments](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments).


### Basic use

~~~
```{r}
# this is some comment
# this is more comment
```

::: {.fragment data-code-focus="1"}
When this fragment is shown, the first line of code will have the `focus` class added to it and it gets highlighted.
:::

::: {.fragment data-code-focus="1-2"}
 Another fragment. This time, both lines will now have the `focus` class.
:::
~~~

Here the first fragment highlights first line (using `data-code-focus="1"`) along with the text within the fragment and the second fragment corresponds to highlighting both line 1 and 2 (using `data-code-focus="1-2"`)

### Multiple code blocks

For slides with multiple code blocks, the `data-code-block` attribute can be used to focus on lines from a particular code block. By default, all fragments will focus on the first code block, unless otherwise specified. For example, 

~~~
```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 1 + 2
```
and, 

```{r}
print(c)
```

::: {.fragment data-code-focus="1-2"}
Here we have declared two variables
:::

::: {.fragment data-code-focus="3"}
Then added them and passed them to c
:::

::: {.fragment data-code-focus="1" data-code-block="2"}
Then print the c
:::
~~~

So here the first two fragment corresponds to first code chunk by default and the second one corresponds to second code chunk (using `data-code-block="2"`).

### Demo

[View the live demo of the above examples here](https://shafayetshafee.github.io/codefocus/template.html)

### Options

Its possible to add these following options under the format,

- [`scorllToFocused`](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/reveal-code-focus#scrolltofocused): `true` or `false` (default is `true`).

- `bgcolor`: "#color". Its possible to define what will be the background color of the highlighted code line using this option.

## TODO:

- Add support for [`data-trim`](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/reveal-code-focus#data-trim)

## Need help

Firstly, I would like to know whether it is useful as custom format. If not, I need help to convert this as a revealjs plugin quarto extension.

You can view live demo of rendered document [here](https://shafayetshafee.github.io/codefocus/template.html) 

- I have tried to implement [`reveal-code-focus`](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/reveal-code-focus) as a [plugin](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/revealjs.html), but sadly enough (I tried for hours (actually the whole day)) but my newbie rusty javascript knowledge would not allow me to convert the actual [`reveal-code-focus.js`](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/reveal-code-focus/blob/master/reveal-code-focus.js) file as a plugin (could not change that `iife` function to [the form](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/revealjs.html#example-attribution) similar to the form shown in the case of [`attribution.js` in the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/formats.html#example-revealjs))

- So then, I resorted to implement this as a custom format.

### Changes I have made mainly

- One important thing, even though in the [`reveal-code-focus`](https://github.com/bnjmnt4n/reveal-code-focus) docs, original [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) is suggested to use, I have not used that. Instead changed the code in `reveal-code-focus.js`, so that it works with the `highlight.js` file shipped with quarto.

- commented the line 60 and changed a bit in line 253 of `reveal-code-focus.js` (I think the `hljs` argument can be discarded for good).

- There was some problem with source code line numbers. Because since an extra `span` with class `line` gets added, existing css for showing line number was not working. So I have changed that a bit `in custom.scss`.

**Thanks.**
